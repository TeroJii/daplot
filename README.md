The goal of daplot is to provide a simplified interface for creating a
plot with a dual axis in ggplot2.

## Installation

You can install the development version of daplot from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("TeroJii/daplot")
```

## Motivation

The [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) package provides an
incredibly rich and extensive functionality for creating a huge variety
of plots. Letâ€™s take the following visualization as an example:

``` r
library(ggplot2)

mtcars |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = mpg)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = wt), color = "blue") +
  geom_line(aes(y = qsec), color = "red") +
  scale_y_continuous(
    name = "wt",
    sec.axis = sec_axis(~ ., name = "qsec")
  )
```

This produces an elegant visualization which allows us to compare two
variables as a function of a third one. However, as we can see, the
magnitude of the variables in absolute units is quite different. In some
cases we might want to compare two variables with different scales more
easily. This requires scaling of one of the variables to fit the scale
of the other variable. This is possible with ggplot2, but it requires
some additional steps and calculations. This is where the `daplot`
function comes in handy. It provides a simplified interface for creating
dual-axis plots without the need for manual scaling.

``` r
library(daplot)

mtcars |> 
  daplot(mpg, wt, qsec)
```

## Using other plotting geoms

The default geom used in `daplot` is `ggplot2::geom_line`. However, you
can (basically) use any geom you like by specifying the `y1_geom` and
`y2_geom` arguments. For example, you can use `ggplot2::geom_point` to
create a scatter plot:

``` r
set.seed(123)

data.frame(
  x = 1:10,
  y1 = rnorm(10, 10, 2),
  y2 = rnorm(10, 100, 20)
) |> 
  daplot(x, y1, y2, y1_geom = ggplot2::geom_point, y2_geom = ggplot2::geom_point)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-example-points-1.png" width="100%" />

Specifying `y2_geom` is actually not needed here, as it defaults to the
same geom as `y1_geom` if not provided.

### Combining different geoms

We can also use `daplot` to combine different plot geoms for the two
variables.

## Responsible use of dual-axis plots

Dual-axis plots can be useful for comparing two variables with different
scales, but they can also be misleading if not used carefully. It is
important to ensure that the scaling of the variables does not distort
the interpretation of the data. Always consider whether a dual-axis plot
is the best way to represent your data, and provide clear labels and
legends to help interpret the plot correctly.
